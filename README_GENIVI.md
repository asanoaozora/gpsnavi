Navigation Open Source Project
==============================

This recipe for Navigation demo is intended to be built outside AGL.
The DBus based APIs used by this demo (see src/api folder) are aligned with the release Nostromo of GENIVI:
https://github.com/GENIVI/navigation/tree/73f74aadc03a1aeffb0937220dca803e8d7149b8/api

## How-to build
./configure --enable-standalone 
additional option:
--enable-verbose --> make with -DNAVI_TRACE_DEBUG to log runtime messages
NB: To test it under Ubuntu (with weston), please comment line 30 of src/glview_wayland.c to unuse IVI_SHELL)
make

cd src/hmi
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
(it also generates the HMI)
make 
make install

## How-to generate the QML HMI style-sheet
The native HMI is gtk based, but it's also possible to connect to the GENIVI FSA HMI. First it's needed to generate it:
./src/hmi/prepare.sh -i ./src/hmi/gimp/genivi-theme/800x480/


## Usage

1. Please download the data from the following URL.
    http://agl.wismobi.com  - navi_data.tar.gz
2. Extract TAR file in any place
3. run

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    NAVI_DATA_DIR=./navi_data/japan_TR9; export NAVI_DATA_DIR

    navi

## To test 

This code has been tested under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
Under the test folder there are some test scripts in Python that allows to test the APIs. 
(tested under Weston)
./test-map-viewer-control.py -l location_tokyo.xml
--> zoom in/out
./test-route-calculation.py -r route_tokyo.xml
--> route calculation
./test-guidance.py -r route_tokyo.xml
--> route calculation and guidance
